# Crayon DPi30 Secure Synapse Landing Zone Repository

This project deploys a secure data lakehouse solution. Microsoft design principles, recommended technology choices and security best practices are all implemented with this solution. We primarily focus on the security considerations and key technical decisions.


## Prerequisites
You must have an **existing** resource group which will be used for all deployments.

> **Note:** All templates are developed for Azure Resource Manager.


## Deploy

Before you hit the "Deploy to Azure" button, make sure you review the details about the services deployed in [Secure Synapse README](SecureSynapseARM\README.md).

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_CreateUIDef/CustomDeploymentBlade/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FZachNichter%2FSecureSynapse%2Fmain%2Fdeploy%2Fazuredeploy.json/uiFormDefinitionUri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FZachNichter%2FSecureSynapse%2Fmain%2Fdeploy%2FcreateUiDefinition.json)


> **Note:** The "Deploy to Azure" button above will redirect you to the Azure Portal with a reference to the resulting [ARM template file](./SecureSynapseARM/azuredeploy.json) generated by Crayon.

> **Important:** This deployment accelerator is meant to be executed under no interference from Azure Policies that deny certain configurations as they might prevent the its successful completion. Please use a sandbox environment if you need to validate the deployment resulting configuration before you run it against other environments under Azure Policies.
